# Passwords are validated by comparing a user-provided
# value with a known value that’s stored. Either it’s correct or
# it’s not.
# Create a simple program that validates userlogin credentials.
# The program must prompt the user for a username and
# password. The program should compare the password given
# by the user to a known password. If the password matches,
# the program should display “Welcome!” If it doesn’t match,
# the program should display “I don’t know you.”
# 
# Example Output
# What is the password? 12345
# I don't know you.
# Or
# What is the password? abc$123
# Welcome!
# 
# Constraints
# • Use an if/else statement for this problem.
# • Make sure the program is case sensitive.

pass_collection = ["pass", "abc$123", "contra"]

password = input("What is the password? ")

if (password in pass_collection):
