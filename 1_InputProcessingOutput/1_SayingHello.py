# The “Hello, World” program is the first program you learn
# to write in many languages, but it doesn’t involve any input.
# So create a program that prompts for your name and prints
# a greeting using your name.
#
# Example Output
# What is your name? Brian
# Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!
#
# Constraint
# • Keep the input, string concatenation, and output separate.

nombre = input("What is your name? ")
mensaje = "Hello, " + nombre + ", nice to meet you!"
print(mensaje)
