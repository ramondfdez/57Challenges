# Arrays are great for storing possible responses from a program. If you combine that with a random number generator,
# you can pick a random entry from this list, which works
# great for games.
# Create a Magic 8 Ball game that prompts for a question and
# then displays either “Yes,” “No,” “Maybe,” or “Ask again
# later.”
#
# Example Output
# What's your question? Will I be rich and famous?
# Ask again later.
#
# Constraint
# • The value should be chosen randomly using a pseudo
# random number generator. Store the possible choices
# in a list and select one at random.

answers = ["Yes", "No", "Maybe", "Ask again later"]

question = input("What's your question? ")

index = random.randint(0,3)
